# Data Visualization Project: Adult Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The aim is to provide insights into the dataset through various visualizations, including bar plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.

## Dataset

The Adult dataset contains demographic information about individuals from the 1994 Census database, including attributes like age, education, work class, and income. You can access the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).

## Project Structure


## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization.

## Visualizations Created

1. **Bar Plots**:
    - **Distribution of Workclass**: Shows the count of individuals across different work classes.

2. **Histograms**:
    - **Distribution of Age**: Illustrates the age distribution of individuals in the dataset.

3. **Box Plots**:
    - **Boxplot of Age**: Visualizes the spread and outliers in the age distribution.

4. **Correlation Matrix**:
    - **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays the correlation coefficients between numerical variables.

5. **Count Plot**:
    - **Workclass vs Income**: Compares income distribution across different work classes.

6. **Pair Plot**:
    - **Pairplot of Age, Hours Per Week, and Education Number**: Shows pairwise relationships colored by income.
